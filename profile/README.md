**“Many startups and growing teams find traditional web development models restrictive—often
complicating innovation and predictable budgeting.”**

## A bit about me

Hey, I'm Carlos Santiago, founder of **Kurocado Studio**. I run my own freelance studio specializing
in transparent, modular, and user-focused software development. My main goal is to tackle the usual
headaches that plague web projects—things like scope creep, vague timelines, and unclear costs—so
startups and growing businesses can confidently move forward.

## What I'm solving

You've probably experienced or at least seen how traditional dev agencies tend to:

- Let **scope creep** run wild without clear communication.
- Depend heavily on **hourly retainers**, complicating budgets.
- Provide **opaque billing**, causing mistrust.
- Consistently miss **key deadlines**, hurting business momentum.
- Deliver solutions that are either **overengineered** or fall short of expectations.

I structured Kurocado Studio specifically to tackle these issues head-on, especially for businesses
with tighter budgets needing practical and effective solutions:

- **Transparency & Flexibility** – Clear project scopes upfront, predictable budgets, and freedom to
  pivot when needed.
- **Effective Project Management** – A modular, agile-friendly approach that maintains
  accountability and ensures continuous improvement.

This approach ultimately gives clients better **budget clarity**, stronger **project control**, and
ensures **user-friendly results**—everything growing businesses need to innovate without unnecessary
friction.

## Who I'm working with

I primarily focus on **four groups** in the Chicago area (though remote partnerships are always
welcome):

1. **Startup Founders** – Looking for user-centered MVPs and agile approaches to secure funding and
   scale quickly.
2. **Small Business Owners** – Seeking straightforward digital transformations and cost-effective
   e-commerce solutions.
3. **Web & Marketing Agencies** – Requiring specialized dev or UX skills for unique projects.
4. **Technical Managers** – Outsourcing specialized tasks or updating legacy systems with modern,
   secure code.

## Why collaborate with me?

1. **Budget Clarity** – Clear, itemized proposals, no hidden surprises.
2. **Iterative & Agile** – Regular check-ins and flexibility in scope.
3. **UX-Centric Design** – Every decision revolves around actual user needs.
4. **Modern Tech Stack** – Skilled with interactive visuals, 3D tech like Three.js, and frameworks
   like Remix, React, NestJS, and advanced TypeScript best practices.
