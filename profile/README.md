# Welcome!

I'm Carlos Santiago — a Front-End Engineer with 7+ years of experience across engineering and
product design. I started in UX/UI for enterprise and consumer brands, then transitioned into
building scalable, performant web apps. I focus on product design, design systems, front-end
architecture, and building with React and TypeScript.

**Kurocado Studio** serves as a hands-on environment where I explore the full product development
lifecycle — applying design, engineering, and product strategy, shaped by my master’s in business
management and real-world UX/front-end engineering practice.

While I’m actively exploring full-time opportunities, this space helps me stay sharp: I run small
projects like products, apply my business background, and experiment through Daily UI challenges,
React/TypeScript builds, and design system work.

### Featured Projects

**[Kurocado Studio Platform](https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/platform)** A modular TypeScript
platform that powers reusable CI/CD pipelines, testing, identity access management, and developer
tooling. Built for fast product prototyping with production-level scaffolding.

**[Daily UI Challenge](https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/daily-ui)** A curated collection of daily
UI challenges implemented in both React and Vue. Designed to practice product thinking, interaction
patterns, and accessibility-first implementation.

**[Figma to Framework](https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/figma-to-framework)** A token-driven UI
library whose look and feel can be updated in Figma and propagated—via Token Studio—into live React
and Vue components. Built for design system scalability and true design-to-code workflows.

**[Engineering Styleguide](https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/styleguide)** A shared style guide for
standardizing linting, formatting, and commit conventions across studio and client projects. Enables
consistency, contributor alignment, and smoother onboarding.

### Let's Talk

If you're a hiring manager looking for a front-end engineer with strong product instincts — or a
startup in need of fast, thoughtful prototyping — I’d love to connect. I bring a cross-functional
mindset shaped by hands-on experience in design, development, and systems thinking.
