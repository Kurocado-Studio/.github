## Who I Am

I’m Carlos Santiago, founder of **Kurocado Studio**. I operate as a **freelance studio** focused on
transparent, modular, and user-centric software development. My goal is to solve common pitfalls in
web projects—from scope creep to missed deadlines—so that startups and growing teams can move
forward with confidence.

## Problem Statement

Traditional development shops often:

- Allow **scope creep** without clear communication.
- Rely on **hourly retainers** that complicate tight budgets.
- Lack **transparent billing**, fostering mistrust.
- Miss **critical deadlines**, stalling growth.
- Deliver **overengineered** or **under-delivered** solutions.

I’ve structured Kurocado Studio to address these challenges, especially for businesses operating on
limited resources who need **practical, user-driven** solutions.

- **Transparency & Flexibility** – Offering clear project scopes, predictable budgets, and the
  option to pivot without penalty.
- **Structured Project Management** – A modular, agile-aligned process that ensures accountability
  and continuous improvement.

Together, these strategies enhance **budget certainty**, **project control**, and **UX-driven
outcomes**—everything growing businesses need to innovate without the usual headaches.

## Target Market

I primarily serve **four key segments** in Chicago (though I’m open to working with clients
elsewhere):

1. **Startup Founders** – Need agile development and user-driven MVPs to secure funding and grow
   fast.
2. **Small Business Owners** – Want digital upgrades and e-commerce solutions without hidden costs.
3. **Web & Marketing Agency Recruiters** – Seek specialized dev or UX support for niche projects.
4. **Technical Managers** – Look to outsource specialized tasks or modernize legacy systems
   securely.

## Why Work With Me?

1. **Budget Transparency** – Itemized proposals, no hidden fees.
2. **Iterative & Agile** – Frequent check-ins, flexible scope control.
3. **UX-Driven** – Every design choice revolves around real user needs.
4. **Cutting-Edge Tech** – 3D, interactive visuals, modern frameworks.
